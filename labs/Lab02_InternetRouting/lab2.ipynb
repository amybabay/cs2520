    "\n",
    "### Traceroute basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Traceroute (or `mtr`) works by sending probes with specific time-to-live (TTL)\n",
    "values. When a router gets a packet with a TTL of 0, the router drops the\n",
    "packet and returns an \"ICMP TTL Exceeded\" response to the source. Therefore,\n",
    "by sending probes with increasing TTL values, we can map the path between two\n",
    "hosts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, when we send a packet with TTL 1, the first router on the path\n",
    "will decrement the TTL, see that it has reached 0, drop it, and send an ICMP\n",
    "TTL Exceeded to the source. The source can then note the source address of the\n",
    "ICMP TTL Exceeded to find the first router on the path. It can also measure\n",
    "the time between sending the probe and getting a response to measure the\n",
    "roundtrip time to that router. It can then repeat this with TTL 2 to find the\n",
    "second router, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get more information about each router on the path, we can also:\n",
    "\n",
    "* use a [reverse DNS lookup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_DNS_lookup)\n",
    "  to get the hostname associated with the router's IP address\n",
    "* look the router IP address up in the [Internet Routing\n",
    "  Registry](https://www.radb.net/) to get its AS number\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpreting `mtr` output\n",
    "\n",
    "Each line in the output above corresponds to one router on the path from the source to the destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at the first line:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/mtr-line1.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we see information about the first hop in our path:\n",
    "\n",
    "* the *hop number* is 1\n",
    "* the *AS number* is unknown (shown as AS???)\n",
    "* the router's *hostname* shows as \"_gateway\" (This IP address typically serves as the default gateway or the router's IP address within a private network)\n",
    "* the router's IP address is 10.20.4.1\n",
    "* the loss rate (percent of probes that did not receive a response) is 0.0\n",
    "* the number of probes sent is 10\n",
    "* the last observed RTT is 0.2 ms\n",
    "* the average RTT over all 10 probes is 0.1 ms\n",
    "* the best (shortest) observed RTT is 0.1 ms\n",
    "* the worst observed RTT is 0.2 ms\n",
    "* the standard deviation of RTTs is 0.0\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, if we look at line 7 of the output\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/mtr-line7.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "we see information about the 7th hop in our path:\n",
    "\n",
    "* the *hop number* is 7\n",
    "* the *AS number* is 20080 (This AS is AMPATH (America's Path) which was developed in 2000 as a high performance exchange point in Miami, Florida, United States. AMPATH assists peer based and network research between U.S. and international research and education networks.)\n",
    "* the router's *hostname* is 'et-0-0-1-67.rt05.bb.ampath.net'\n",
    "* the router's IP address is 170.39.8.33\n",
    "* the loss rate (percent of probes that did not receive a response) is 0.0\n",
    "* the number of probes sent is 10\n",
    "* the last observed RTT is 0.8 ms\n",
    "* the average RTT over all 10 probes is 1.4 ms\n",
    "* the best (shortest) observed RTT is 0.8 ms\n",
    "* the worst observed RTT is 6.2 ms\n",
    "* the standard deviation of RTTs is 1.7\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that as you saw with hop 1, you may not get all of this information for every hop. \n",
    "If the AS number is listed as `???`. This just means it could not find a record of\n",
    "the ASN for that IP address (which could be also be because the IP address is a private address). `mtr` uses the Internet Routing Registry, and you\n",
    "can verify that there is no record for a IP address by going to the website:\n",
    "[https://www.radb.net](https://www.radb.net).\n",
    "\n",
    "As another example, see hop 6:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/mtr-line6.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Hop 6 has the AS number and an IP address but no host name.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, you can infer the AS from the hostname, or the other way around. In this case, we have the AS number AS62. This is from a data center company 'CyrusOne'\n",
    "([AS62](https://bgp.he.net/AS62)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some lines may have no information, like the following at hop 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/mtr-line3.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This just means the router did not send back an ICMP response (often because it\n",
    "is configured not to send ICMP TTL exceeded messages).\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, the final line of the output will be the destination host, but this\n",
    "may also be missing if the destination is configured not to send ICMP TTL\n",
    "exceeded messages."
